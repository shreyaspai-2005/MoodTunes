# MoodTunes
### 'MoodTunes,' an AI-powered mini-project addressing the challenge of personalizing music recommendations based on a user's real-time emotional state.
This system innovatively analyzes user-generated journal entries to detect their underlying mood, subsequently curating and linking to a tailored music playlist on Spotify.
Leveraged Python with the Flask framework for backend development, enabling robust API communication. Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Hugging Face Transformers (specifically the 'cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model') for advanced sentiment analysis of unstructured text - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/roberta.
Designed a responsive user interface with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.
Key functionalities include real-time mood detection from text input, dynamic music genre recommendations, and direct access to pre-selected Spotify playlists corresponding to detected moods.
As our 2nd-year AIML mini-project, I and my two friends were responsible for the full-stack development, including backend logic, API integration, and frontend design.
This project demonstrates practical application of AI/ML for enhanced user experience in personalized digital content. 
Future enhancements could include real-time mood tracking, integration with more music services, and user feedback loops for adaptive recommendations.
